## Overview
This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various employee-related factors, we build a predictive model to help organizations identify potential attrition risks and take proactive measures.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/employee-attrition-dataset/data) and includes various features related to employee demographics, work experience, and job satisfaction.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key attrition drivers.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for attrition prediction.
- Provide insights into factors contributing to employee attrition.
